# Data-Structure

The study of algorithms and data structures is key to understanding what computer science is all about.Learning computer
science is not unlike learning any other type of difficult subject matter.The only way to be successful is through deliberate 
and incremental exposure to the fundamental ideas.A beginning computer scientist needs practice so that there is a thorough 
understanding before continuing on to the more complex parts of the curriculum. The Data structure  designed here in this repository to serve as a help on data structures and algorithms. In Ihis repository, I covered abstract data types and data structurcs, writing algorithm, and solving problems. I provied a number of data structure and solved classic problem that arise.
